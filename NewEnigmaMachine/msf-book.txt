USE ANY EXTRA ENERGY AT THE END OF THE DAY ON THE GREEN NOTEBOOK PIECE

zemo, scientiest,   secur, assult

Baron Zemo works great on AIM. He gets turn 1 immunity, so you can debuff 
with ScS and not hit him. I used Graviton, Assaulter, ScS, Security, Zemo (left to right) 
for 7-1 to 7-3, and I still use that team in RTA when Zemo isn't banned and I need a lot of villain turns.
